I currently work as an Energy Insight Lead at National Grid ESO, developing their Future Energy Scenarios. I am also the Event Lead of Women in Non-Traditional Roles in National Grid, UK. Prior to this, I was a Lead Research Engineer at the R&D Centre of EDF Energy UK and the Digital Lead of EDF Women's Network. Before that, I was a modelling analyst at Energy Systems Catapult, working as part of their system integration and innovation team and exploring energy storage and second-life batteries. I have a passion for energy storage and hence, I pursued a PhD in battery storage in the Centre for Doctoral Training in Power Networks of The University of Manchester (UoM). In addition, I obtained my first professional qualification as Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) with the Project Management Institute (PMI) in December 2017.</p>

                              In my dissertation with title “Pumped Storage Hydropower Technologies for Wind Energy Storage”, I analysed how fixed and variable speed pumped-hydro turbines affect the overall efficiency and the profit of a wind farm, when the wind farm and the pumped-hydro units are co-located. The aim was to reduce curtailment of wind energy. Supervisor: Prof. Costas Vournas (Grade 10.00/10.00). Software used: Matlab, Simulink </p>
